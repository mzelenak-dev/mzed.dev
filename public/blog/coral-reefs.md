# Coral Reefs: Rainforests of the Ocean

Oceans cover more than seventy percent of our planet, providing food,
oxygen, and climate stability. Coral reefs, often called the rainforests
of the sea, host extraordinary biodiversity, sheltering countless marine
species. Unfortunately, pollution, overfishing, and rising temperatures
threaten their survival. Restoring coral reefs involves planting
fragments of living coral, reducing coastal pollution, and adopting
responsible fishing practices. Protecting our oceans isn't just about
fish; it's about protecting people, economies, and cultures that depend
on the sea. Marine protected areas and international cooperation are
crucial tools in this mission. When we reduce plastic use, lower carbon
emissions, and support ocean-friendly policies, we help safeguard future
generations. The ocean's vast blue expanse represents hope and renewal,
reminding us that life on Earth is tied deeply to the sea.
